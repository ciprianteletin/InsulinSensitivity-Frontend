        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>InsulinX provides a simple solution to calculate multiple index from a selective list based
        on the most used indexes in medical studies related to diabetes. This application is intended for
        both specialized persons and non-specialized. For non-specialized patients, we provide a additional page
        "Read me" where you can find informations about diabetes, how those indices are evaluated and how
        the result are computed.</p>
        <p>The application was built to be used without an account, providing all features needed in order
        to calculate and see the results based on the resulted values and inserted data. However, the application
        provides additional features for the ones that have an account created.</p>

        <p>For a person without an account, the application is limited to a specific list of features, including:
        Register, access to Read Me page to find more information about diabetes, access to Contact Me page,
        useful for contacting the developer team regarding bugs or implementation of additional features. But the most
        important feature is the possibility to select a list of desired indexes and to calculate them using minimal
